			<p>The PVD75 System is capable of electron beam evaporation. The system was
			designed and built by Kurt J. Lesker Company. The depositions can be fully 
			automated. Electron beam evaporation is a deposition process is where a piece
			of the material (source) is heated until it evaporates. The material then 
			condenses on all the surrounding surfaces, including the substrate. The 
			electron beam is used to heat the source material. This process is often 
			used for metals, and anti-reflection coating due to it quick deposition 
			rate and cheaper material costs.</p>

			<p>RF/DC Magnetron Sputtering results in many collisions, smaller grain size, 
			and better adhesion of material in thin films and coatings. RF (radio frequency)
			sputtering is good for insulting material and DC (Diode) sputtering is good for
			metals. Magnetron sputtering works by argon gas is flowed into the chamber, 
			where it gets excited. This produces argon ions and electrons. The ions get 
			accelerated to the surface of the target (the material that needs to be deposited)
			and are aided by a magnet, which traps the electron near the target and keeping
			the plasma going. The bombarding ions transfer momentum to the Target atoms. 
			This causes the Target atoms to go into a gas phase and travel to the substrate
			forming a thin film or coating.</p>

			<p>The Linear RF/Pulse DC Magnetron Sputtering Vacuum System is capable of RF 
			magnetron sputter deposition of CdS and CdTe materials. The system was designed
			and built by Kurt J. Lesker Company. The depositions can be fully automated. 
			The system has the capability of in-situ through the glass Spectroscopic Ellipsometer
			(SE) measurement. In-situ SE measurements allows for data through-the-glass without
			breaking the vacuum after the CdS/CdTe deposition on TCO/Glass substrate. This 
			equipment is also capable of pulse DC magnetron sputtering.</p>

			<p>The CMS24s are RF/DC Magnetron Sputtering Vacuum Systems that were designed
			and built by Kurt J. Lester Company. There are two dedicated RF/DC magnetron sputters
			that can be partial automated for metal depositions or oxide depositions. Use mainly
			for fabrication of CIGS solar cells. CMS24-1 is used for deposition of molybdenum back
			contact layer and CMS24-2 is used for deposition of Transparent Conducting Oxides
			(TCO) and Buffer layers. Each system contains 2 three inch RF sputtering gun and a single
			three inch DC sputtering gun.</p>

			<p>The Utility Sputter is a RF sputtering system that was built in house. It contains a 
			single three inch RF sputtering gun. The system is employed primarily for exploratory 
			studies of newer materials or device fabrications. </p>

			<p>The computer controlled multi-chamber cassette cluster tool system was designed 
			and built by MV Systems. The system is equipped with 7 modular process zones (MPZs)
			having ports for Spectroscopic Ellipsometers and one load lock (LL) around a central
			isolation and transfer zone (ITZ). There are 4 Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
			(PECVD) chambers, 2 dual cathode sputter chambers, 1 sputter chamber with mapping
			ellipsometer and a load lock for the entry and exit of the substrate carrier with 
			the option of preheating / degassing. The system can be used for the deposition of 
			thin film semiconductor materials and devices on rigid and flexible substrates and collecting
			real time data with the help of ellipsometers. Currently RF sputtering chambers are equipped
			with metal, ZnO and ITO targets whereas, PECVD chambers can be used for intrinsic, n-type
			and p-type amorphous/nano-crystalline silicon. The system also includes: pumping, electronics
			cabinet, computer and gas manifold. The high vacuum pumping and the process gas pumping of
			MPZs are provided via turbo molecular pumps backed by rotary vane pumps. The system can be 
			partially operated locally via the control panel on the electronics rack or via the computer
			interface in manual, semi-auto or fully automatic modes. The system is comprised of proper 
			disposal of toxic/pyrophoric gases as well as Emergency gas off system.</p>
